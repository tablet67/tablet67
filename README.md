- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tablet67 - intrigued by AI and SD. I bought my first computer in 1982 and built a few websites during the 1990s but became distracted by other projects.  I'm now retired and fill my days with exercise, books, family, friends, and church.  
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in AI and SD as a hobbyist, but bugs like JSONDecodeError crash my machine after loading.  I can't wait for SD to stabilize on my machine so I can start learning.
